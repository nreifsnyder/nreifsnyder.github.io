				<p>When I start lacrosse, this upcoming season, I hope to get onto the Red Land Lacrosse team. I'll join them for "school spirit," and I know some of the players. Hopefully ill be able to play offensivly, but if I dont then I wont care, at least I get to play.</p>
				<p>The whole reason im going into lacrosse is to get back into sports. I figure, "might as well go for a more physical sport to get ready for others." I used to do football & basketball, but i ended up quiting both, for the sole purpose of me worrying about my grades in school. Now, since im in High School, I thought i might get back into sports and, since i know the lacrosse team, thats what ill go for.</p>
